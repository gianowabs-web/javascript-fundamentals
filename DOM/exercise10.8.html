    TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS

      1.Create an array of names. you can add as many as you want- all the string values 
        will be output onto the page within a table.
      2. select the page elements as Javascript object
      3. Add a function and also invoke that function within the javascript code the function can
      be called build in() as it will be building the page content. within the build function  you
      will be setting up the html in a table
      4. Create a table named html and within the tags, loop through the contents of the array and output 
      the results into the html table.
      5. Add a class called box to one of the cells that has the index value of the item from the array,
      in adding  the same class to the elements for each additional row
      6. as you create the html for the elements within the tr element create an attribute
       called data-row in the main row element that includes the index value of the item from the array 
       In addition add another attribute within the element called data-name that will contain
        the text output
      7 within the attribute of the same tr element object also add onclick to invoke the function named 
      getData passing the current element object as this in to the function parameter
      8. Add the table HTML code to the page 
      9.create a function named getData that will be invoked once the html tr element is clicked.
       Once the tr element is clicked  use getattribute to get the attribute values of the row value
       and the contents of the text and store them in different variables.
      10. using the values in the attributes stored in the preceeding step output the value
       into the message element attributes within the element on the page .
       11. Once the user clicks the element on the page, it will display details comming from the element
       attributes within the element with the id of message.
