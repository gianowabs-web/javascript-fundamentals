    <!--
    Events are things that happen on a web page, like clicking on something, moving the mouse over
    an element changing an element and there are many more. we have seen how to add an onclick event handler
    already.
    there is a way to register event handlers using javascript as well we call this events listeners using 
    using event listeners we can add multiple event to one element this way javascript is constantly checking 
    or listening for certain events to the elements on the page adding event listeners is a two step process
            1. Select the element you want to add an event listener to.
            2. use the addEventListener("event", function)syntax to add the event
    Even if it is two step it can be done in one line of code:

    document.getElementById("square").addEventListener("click", changeColor);

    this is getting the element with the id square and adding the changeColor function as the event 
    for whenever it gets clicked.
    N/B:when we use event listner we remove the prefix from the event type For exmple click here reference
    the same type as onclick but we have removed the on prefix.
    another common one is when the page is done loading with onload;

           window.onload= function (){
           // whatever needs to happen after loading
           // for example adding event listeners to elements
           }

    -->
           <div id="square" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: grey;">change color</div>
           <script>
            window.onload = function (){
                document.getElementById("square").addEventListener("click", changeColor);
            }
            function changeColor(){
                let red = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
                let green = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
                let blue = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
                this.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`;
            }
           </script>
