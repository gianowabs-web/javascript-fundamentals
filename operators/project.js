miles-to kilometers converter
create a variable that contains a value in miles, convert in 
kilometers, and log the value in kilometers in the following format
"the distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles"

1 mile = 1.60934 km

BMI calculator
set values for height in inches and weight in pounds then convert 
the values to centimeters and kilos, Outputting 
the result to the console:
 > 1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm
 > 2.2046 pounds is equal to 1 kilos
 Output the results. Then, calculate and log the BMI:
 this is equal to weight (in kilos) divided by  squared 
 height (in meters). Output the results to the console.
