Operators
-they are used when you want to work with numbers, in doing
calculations.
-Operators are used to operate on values.

Examples 
  a) Arithmetric Operators
  -Arithmetric Operatorscan be used to perform operations with numbers.
  - they include:
     addition +
     subtraction -
     Multiplication *
     Division /
     Exponent **
     Modulus %
     Unary Operators (increment ++, decrement --)
     prefix and postfix Operators.
b) Assignment Operators
- assignment operator is used to assign values to a variable.
- the character for basic assignment operation is "=".
-Example
    let t = 7;
    - here assignment operartor "=" assings the values "7" to the variable "t".

we have compound assignment operator that combine the assignment operator
example:
   addition assignment +=
   subtraction assignment -=
   Multiplication assignment *=
   division assignment /=
   modulus assignment %=
   exponent assignment **= 

c) comparison Operators
- the outcome of comparison operators is usually boolean
expression (true or false)
-Example:
    Equal ==
    Not Equal !=
    greater than >, greater than or equal to >=
    less than <, less than or equal to <=

d) logical operators
- Used in situation you want to check two condition in one 
or need to negate a condition, the logical operators come 
in handy. 
- You can use:
     and -&&
     or -||
     not -!
