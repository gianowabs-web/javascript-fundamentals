/*
the syntax:

if (condition){
//action

}
else if (condition){
//action
}
else{
    // action
}
-if the evaluation of the first condition is true
the value e.g action within if block the{action} within the block 
is executed.

- if it is false, the second if block is consdered and also if evaluation of its
condition results to false, the default condition is considered hence the 
else {action}block actio is considered by default because all other conditions 
are false.
