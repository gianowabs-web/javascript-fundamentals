    1. Create a blank element on the page and assign a class to it.
    2. Select the element using its class name.
    3. Assign a variable to the element object from the page.
    4. Update the content of the element to say hello world.
    5. Using the style properties of the element, update the height and width, then 
    add a default background color to it.
    6. Create a function to handle two arguments, the first being a color value as a 
    string and the second being the event object of the trigger. 
    7. In the function, output the color value to the console, and for the event, 
    output the event type to the console.
    8. Add event listeners to the element: mousedown, mouseover, mouseout, and 
    mouseup. For each of these events, send two arguments to the function that 
    you created: a color value and the event object.
    9. Run the code and try it in your browser
