 interactive content
Interactive content is content that responds to the actions of a user. Think, for 
example, of a web app in which you can create postcards dynamically, or play a 
game on a website in a web browser. 
This interactive content is made possible by changing the DOM based on user 
interactions. These interactions could be anything: entering text in an input field, 
clicking somewhere on the page, hovering over a certain element with the mouse, or 
a certain input with the keyboard. All these are called events. We have seen events 
already. But there is actually more to it!


Specifying events
There are three ways to specify events. We have seen each of these in the previous 
chapter, but let's run through them again now. One is HTML-based and the other 
two are JavaScript-based. For this example, we are going to use the click event as 
an example.


Specifying events with HTML
First, the HTML way:
<p id="unique" onclick="magic()">Click here for magic!</p>
The great thing about specifying events this way is that it's quite easy to read this 
code and predict what it is going to do. As soon as you click on the paragraph, the 
function magic() will be triggered. There are some downsides too: you can only 
specify one event this way, and you cannot change the event dynamically either


Here is the first way to do it using JavaScript.
document.getElementById("unique").onclick = function() { magic(); };


Specifying events with event listeners
The last method is using the addEventListener() method to add an event to an 
element. With this, we can specify multiple functions for the same event,
 for example:
     when an element gets clicked.
If we wanted to specify event triggers for all the elements of the 
page, we could do so in a loop for a cleaner coding style.

What is striking for both methods we have looked at—using HTML events and 
assigning to properties—is that the event gets prefixed with on. For example, 
onclick, onload, onfocus, onblur, onchange, etc. This is not the case when we use 
the addEventListener() method, where we specify the event type within the event 
listener without the on prefix, as here, with an alternative to onclick:


document.getElementById("unique").addEventListener("click", magic);

Please note that we are leaving out the parentheses behind the magic function here. 
We cannot send in parameters like this. If that is something you have to do, you'd 
have to wrap the functionality in an anonymous function, like this:

document.getElementById("unique").addEventListener("click", function() 
{ magic(arg1, arg2) });

In this chapter, we may use any of these ways to specify an event. We will mostly 
be using one of the JavaScript options, though.
