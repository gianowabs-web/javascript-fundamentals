Variables
> Variables are addresses or name value in your code that can represent different 
values each time the code runs.
Before we deal with variables we will look at

i) Identifier
_ An identifier is a name that users derive that is used to name concepts
in programming language
_in order t derive the name the following rules must be followed.
a) An identifier can be a combination of letters (A-Z,a-z,0-9).
  Exception
  -you can't begin with a digit, digit should be placed at the end.
  e.g. "9total' is wrong, instead say "total19".

b) space between two words is not allowed, instead put underscore between the words.
  -E.g.
  "Total marks" is wrong instead you can say "total_marks"

  Variable declaration
  . a variable defination and declaration consist of three parts;
    variable defining keywords
      i)let 
      This is used for variables and might have anew value assigned them
      somewhere in the program.
      -let has a block level scope, this bmeans that you can only the variables define with "let" in the specific block of codes 
      in which they are defined.
      - A block of code will always start with {and end with},which is how you recognise them.
       Example:
       let total =100;
      ii) var 
      this is used for variables that may have new value assigned them
      somwwhere in the program.
      Var has a global scope which means that you can use the variables defined
      with var in the entire script.

       Example:
       var result = 150;
    iii) const 
    -it is used for variables that only get the value  assigned once for example the value 
    of pi, which will not change.
    -Example:
      const average = 45;
      average =50
      -this will result in an error.

Comment
> Comment are used to explain what a program is all about.
>any line of code starting with a comment symbol either single line or multiline comment
is automatically is automatically ignored by the interpreter, and execution goes to the line.
>Types  of comments
  a) singleline comment //
  Example: // single line  comment

  b) Multiline comment
  -This allows you right a multiple line sentences as comment.
  Example: 
       /*
            this is a multiline
            comment,
        */
        

ii) Primitive datatypes
-  javascript has seven primitive datatypes
    string
    -strinf is used to store a text value. It is a sequence of chracters 
    there are different ways to declare a string.
        a) double quote 
        b)single quote 
        c) backticks - special templates string in which you can use variables directly
        
    number
    bigint
    boolean
    symbol
    undefined
    null
