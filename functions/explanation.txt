 Basic functions
 - we have built in functions that we have explored example
  Prompt(), log(), push(), shift(), sort()
  - these funtions are predefined in the javascript complier
  - the function definations part is hidden from us we are 
  only interacting with the fuction calling only.

  user defined functions
  -These are functions that we take part in creating both the function defination and the function calling.

  function defination
  fuction defination syntax
  fuction nameOfTheFunction(){
    // content of the function or body of the function
  }
  fuction defination starts with the keyword "function" followed by the function name, which must be
  a valid identfier
  after the function name we have a bracket () inside the bracket we can have parameters or not .
  after bracket we have the opening curly bracket"{and the closing culy bracket}" inside them we the 
  function block of code that is executed when the fuction is called
  - a function defination cannot before until you perform a fuction callbacks
   examples  of the function defination in the inside bracket 
   fuction say hello ()
   example of fuction with parameters
   fuction hello (parameters1,parameters2){
    // block of code goes here
   }

   what is parameters
   parameter - is a variable that gets initalized with the value supplied as arguments during 
   fuction calling
   arguments - is a value supplied during fuction calling to initalize the parameter

   function calling
   - this calling the fuction that you have defined. there are several ways a fuction call is performed
   - the fuction na,e used in the defination must be the same as name used in calling inconsistescy will result 
   in syntax error
   a) simple call
       this is the situation where there is no parameter in the functon call in other words those function without parameters are termed
       as void is called . here the fuction name is supplied with empty bracket

       // fuction defination
         fuction sayHello(){
            console.log("Hello");
         }

       // fuction calling
       sayHello(); .. just called the function directly


    a) call by value
      this is where you supply the values directly inside the brackets of a fuction call
      //parameter function
       function rectangle(length, width){
        let area = length * width;
        console.log(area);
       }

       // function calling
       rectangle(67, 40);

    b) call by reference 
      // fuction defination
       fuction rectangle(length, width){
        let area = length * width;
        console.log(area);

       }
       // funtion calling
        let l = 80
        let w = 45
        rectangle(l, w)
